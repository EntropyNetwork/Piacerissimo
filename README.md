Reactive Firewall For Linux Systems

Many introduction-to-network-intrusion attacks begin with port scans against a target IP range. A distributed network running this firewall and port scanned in such a way results in pings directed back at the scanning machine. This could be great for private networks with adversary opportunities, such as coffeehouses or universities or office buildings. It's probably impolite, at least, to let it ping things on the open internet.
